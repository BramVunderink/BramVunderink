## ✨ About me

Hi! I'm Bram, an aspiring Python developer with a fast-growing passion for building real-world applications. Over the past months I’ve gained hands-on experience through projects such as:


🧠 Building Python apps (CLI, GUI & web-based) incl. AI agents with LangChain<br>
📝 Working with virtual environments, Git & GitHub<br>
🖥 Creating PDF generators, file processors & automation tools<br>
🌐 Deploying web apps with Streamlit<br>
🛠 Solving debugging challenges and learning best practices<br>
📚 Working with APIs, data handling & LLM integrations (LangChain, Gemini)t<br>


I’m still early in my journey, but I learn fast, thrive on problem-solving, and stay highly motivated to grow as a developer. My goals are to become a strong backend engineer, contribute to impactful projects and learn more programming languages.<br>
